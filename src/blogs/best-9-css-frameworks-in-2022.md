The web is constantly evolving and so are the CSS frameworks that make frontend development more productive and enjoyable.

Love them or hate them, CSS frameworks are here to stay. Developers with no prior frontend experience can use some of these frameworks to easily implement user-friendly UIs. Other frameworks are more complex and geared towards power users.

Regardless of your experience level, these frameworks will help you create beautiful layouts faster. In this collection, we’ll go through the best CSS frameworks in the market so that you can choose the right one based on your needs.

## Why Should I Use a CSS Framework?

Before getting into the list, it’s important to understand how and why CSS frameworks are an integral part of modern frontend development.

CSS stylesheets are hard to organize, maintain, and reuse. Even minor style changes require you to write new CSS rules, which at some point might turn your code into a complicated mess.

Ready-to-use classes are the main building blocks of all CSS frameworks. They allow you to apply pre-defined styling rules to HTML elements, such as margins, background colors, and others.

Some frameworks include pre-built components such as menus, cards, or tables. Using these components let you create user-friendly interfaces without a lot of work on your side.

CSS frameworks make your styling workflow productive, clean, and maintainable. By using one of the following frameworks, you’ll save time and avoid many of the headaches that come with CSS coding.

## 1. Bootstrap

I can’t think of a conversation about CSS frameworks that wouldn’t include Bootstrap. Twitter introduced the framework in 2011 to make responsive web design easily accessible to developers.

Since then, the project has evolved to support modern CSS and offers countless features to improve your frontend productivity. As is the case with many popular things, Bootstrap does receive some criticism.

Here are some reasons why you should consider using it in your projects, despite the criticism.

## 2. Foundation

Foundation is the perfect choice for experienced developers who enjoy freedom but want the power of a fully-featured framework.

In reality, Foundation is not just a CSS framework but a family of frontend development tools. These tools can be used either together or completely independently.

Foundation for Sites is the core framework for creating web pages, while Foundation for Emails allows you to build attractive emails that can be read from any device. Motion UI is the final piece of the puzzle, enabling you to create advanced CSS animations.

Foundation is created and maintained by ZURB, a company behind many open source Javascript and CSS projects. A lot of thought has been put into designing this framework, and ZURB uses it extensively in their own projects.

## 3. Bulma

Bulma is a great alternative to Bootstrap, as it features modern code and a unique aesthetic. It’s easy to use and import into your projects and comes with various pre-made components.

It’s highly praised for its simple syntax and minimalistic but aesthetic design. It truly is a framework that can make a dull web page look bright and appealing.

With over 40,000+ stars on GitHub, it’s no longer a niche framework, but rather a force to be reckoned with.

## 4. Tailwind CSS

“Most CSS frameworks do too much” — Tailwind‘s motto clearly explains why it’s a lightweight framework that offers freedom to developers. It doesn’t come with a specific design, but rather allows you to implement your own unique style faster.

It accomplishes that by offering utility classes that make CSS coding almost unnecessary. Experienced frontend developers fall in love with its powerful features, and use it throughout their projects.

## 5. UI Kit

UIKit is a modular frontend framework that allows you to import only the features you need.

It has over 16k stars on GitHub, and it’s chosen by developers for its easy API and clean-cut design.

Additionally, UIKit has a pro version that offers themed pages for WordPress and Joomla, coupled with an easy-to-use page builder.

## 6. Minigram

Milligram is a minimalist CSS framework that has a tight community of developers around it.

The main reason why Milligram is awesome is that you can start with a clean slate when creating your interfaces and it has been designed to increase performance and productivity.

## 7. PureCSS

The Pure CSS framework comes from an unexpected contender in the open source world — Yahoo.

This micro framework is ridiculously tiny, as it only takes up 3.7 KB (compressed) when all modules are used. It offers reusable and responsive CSS modules that can be added to any web project.

## 8. Tachyons

Tachyons is a lesser-known CSS framework that includes advanced utility classes and provides you with dozens of ways to use them.

The project’s documentation explains the development principles, with the most important one being reusability. Tachyons helps you understand your project’s design patterns and promotes reusability throughout your project.

## 9. Materialize CSS

Material design is the design language of choice for many websites and admin themes. It’s developed by Google and used throughout their projects.

Materialize CSS is an open source CSS framework that makes it easy to implement the material design look and feel in your own projects.

It features many interactive components that speed up development and help deliver a great experience to users. Animations are used throughout the framework to provide visual feedback to users, in a way that’s easy for developers to work with.
