## Introduction

A welcome blog post introduces your blog to the world. It shouldn’t consist only of a brief announcement, though, because you’re setting the stage for future content. You must let people know that you’re an authority in your industry and that you’re capable of producing meaty, engaging content.

Think of your welcome or introductory blog post as your audition. You only get one chance to get it right, and your audience will decide based on its content whether they want to return to your blog. Don’t let your anxiety take over, though, because we’re going to share a formula that works.

As for any audition, you must prepare. Know your target audience, buyer personas, product details, and unique selling proposition. All of these concepts will play a part in the structure and content of your welcome blog post.

Additionally, make sure you know your voice and tone backward and forward. You might want to create a style guide that details information like fonts, colors, word choice, punctuation, structure, and more. That way, each blog post remains consistent with the ones that came before it.

Most importantly, your welcome blog post gives you a chance to express your creativity. If you do it right, you’ll earn readers for life.

Earlier, we compared a welcome blog post to an audition. You’re standing in front of the casting directors with your lines memorized or your pitch crafted. It’s time to wow your audience and get the job.

In this case, though, the casting directors are your readers, and your audition isn’t prepared for you. Don’t panic, though, because you can create a compelling welcome blog post with just a few strategies in your tool belt.

Before you begin, make sure you’re willing to commit to a blog. Just like an actor or actress who auditions for a role on Broadway, you’re hoping to get a long-term job. For years, you’ll continue to publish high-quality content, so you don’t want to start down this road if you can’t see it through.

Many business owners start blogs, then abandon them. The latest content becomes weeks, months, and then years old. You don’t want that to happen because you’ll disappoint your prospects and customers. Worse, you’ll appear inattentive and indecisive.

If you’re sure you’re ready to start a business blog, let’s dive into our 15 steps that will teach you how to write a welcome blog post.

### 1. Name Your Business Blog

Every blog needs a name. You can get cute with it if you want, but you can also make it more formal. This is completely up to you.

When choosing a name for your business blog, think about words, phrases, and jargon to which your audience might relate. Consider creating a Venn diagram or use a similar brainstorming tool to figure out what words might go well together.

You can also call it “The [Business Name] Blog.

### 2. Identify Your Blog’s Target Audience

Once you’ve named your business blog, you need to figure out who will read it. You’re identifying your target audience — one that overlaps with the audience for your online courses and other digital products.

Start by creating multiple buyer personas. These are fictional characters that represent your ideal customers. Think about the various reasons a prospect might express interest in your online courses. Create a buyer persona for each.

Each buyer persona should include demographics, motivations, pain points, and other detailed information. The more specific you get, the more targeted your welcome blog post will become. Plus, you can create future blog posts for each of your buyer personas to target potential customers.

How do you narrow down your target audience? Take a look at your current and past customers. What do they have in common? How did they find your business? What do they want to get out of your online courses?

If you don’t have any current or past customers, you might have to get more creative. Visit blogs that are similar to the one you want to create. Read the comments sections of the individual blog posts, survey the blog topics, and get a feel for what the blog tries to convey. You’re learning about your target audience and the competition at the same time.
